DorkbotPDX Code of Conduct


DorkbotPDX is committed to providing a socially safe and friendly environment
for people doing strange things with electricity. We welcome all,
regardless of techical experience, gender, sexual orientation/identity, age,
ability, ethnicity, religion, or physical/biological cybernetics.

DorkbotPDX expects attendees to be:

* RESPECTFUL - Don't seek to irritate, annoy, or otherwise disrupt others.
* CAUTIOUSLY HELPFUL - Share what you know, but don't assume you know more than
  someone else.
* ENGAGED - If you're curious and wondering, just ask. If you're asked, 
  try to answer or brainstorm.

Because we wish to foster an open, diverse, and engaged community, <a

discrimination or harassment</a>. We are particularly sensitive to
discrimination against and harassment of socially marginalized groups.

Any person in violation of these guidelines may be warned or asked to leave.
