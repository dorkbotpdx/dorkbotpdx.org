    <p>So, it's come to my attention (thanks to Audrey and Mark) that TechShop is going to be opening a Portland facility sometime in the middle of 2008. For those of you who don't know about it, TechShop is pure geek heaven. It's a DIY facility that stocks the tools to build pretty much anything. You can become a member at various levels and have access to everything from machine tools to laser cutters and probably any sort of woodworking device you can imagine. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/09/techshop-geek-h.html">Guy Kawasaki</a> did a great walk through of the original Menlo Park location. You can find out more about the Portland facility <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/09/techshop-geek-h.html">here</a>.</p>
